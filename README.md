Basic business website 
by Mubeena Ali

This project is a simple business website of a cafe. This site has a home page, a menu page, a contact page and location page. The user can can click on each of the links located on top to look at the cafe, menu, location, contact page. The contact page has a form for the user to fill out and send.

This project was created with HTML,CSS and Bootstrap.

There are 4 wireframe images (indexpage.png, menupage.png, locationpage.png, contactpage.png).

To be able to view this website you need the following files: index.html, menu.html, location.html, contact.html, style.css and the 7 images.

Future Improvements:

Create a order button so the user can make a purchase, like a cart
Chat box
Change the color of the link when they are viewing that page from the rest of the links.
To clear the form input boxes.
Have a location map that the user can see by plugging in their zip code.
